## Chapter 1: Introductions

### Background
ArthMitra is a financial management application designed to help users track their expenses, analyze their spending patterns, and receive personalized financial advice. The name "ArthMitra" combines "Arth" (meaning wealth or finance in Sanskrit) and "Mitra" (meaning friend), positioning the application as a friendly financial assistant. In today's fast-paced world, managing personal finances effectively has become increasingly challenging, and ArthMitra aims to address this need through an intuitive mobile application enhanced with AI capabilities.

### Problem Statement
